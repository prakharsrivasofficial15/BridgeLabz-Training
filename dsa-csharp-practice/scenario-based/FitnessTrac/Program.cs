Performance optimization.FitnessTracker – Daily Step Count Ranking (Bubble Sort)

Story: A fitness app tracks steps taken by each user in a small group (less than 20 people). At
the end of the day, it displays rankings. Since the list is small and frequently shuffled due to
last-minute step syncing, a simple Bubble Sort runs quickly to generate the leaderboard.
Concepts Involved:
● Bubble Sort
● Frequent updates
● Real-time re-sorting
